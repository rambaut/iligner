Let's get this beastie under way. This page is to outline (and prioritize) tasks. Add what is needed and tag the ones you want to tackle.

With reference to the DesignOutline here is a list of things to be done:

  # Create a project using xCode. I suggest we use the "CoreData Document Application with SpotLight plugin" template. One of us should do this and then pass an archive of it to the others. We should then check in all the relevant bits into the SVN repository here.
  # Editing the NIB files to create the first draft UI and to auto-generate templates for the View objects.
  # Start work with CoreData (if we decide that is what we want to use) to create a fast, flexible, alignment 'engine'.
  # Create Controller objects to tie the two together.
