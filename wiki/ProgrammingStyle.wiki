#Some ideas about a consistent programming style.

= Introduction =

Lets lay down some rules for the programming style that we are all comfortable with.

= Style Rules =

* Use fully verbose identifiers (both methods and variables). The exception being local iterator variables (such as i, j etc)

* Class names should have a two letter name-space identifier. I suggest 'IL' as in ILAlignmentView.
