\f0\fs24 \cf0 This project is designed to allow the testing of the sequence processing capabilities of the BioCocoa framework.  The interface has two NSTextViews (an input and an output) and a single button.  The button triggers the "process:" method of the single controller object, which has outlets for each of the NSTextViews.\
\
It is your job to fill in the "process:" method with code that uses whatever you need to test within the BioCocoa framework - the demo app is set to build the framework when building the demo.  The output NSTextView allows you to dump text along the way or at the finish in order to confirm things are working.}
